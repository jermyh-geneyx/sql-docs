# Microsoft Copilot in Azure with Azure SQL Database

[!INCLUDE [appliesto-sqldb](../includes/appliesto-sqldb.md)]

[Microsoft Copilot in Azure](/azure/copilot/overview) with Azure SQL Database is a [capability](/azure/copilot/capabilities#perform-tasks) of the Microsoft Azure Copilot experience that enhances the management and operation of Azure services, providing robust capabilities for SQL-dependent applications. It provides a conversational interface for users to interact with their databases, allowing them to ask questions and receive relevant answers based on the context of their database. It improves productivity in the Azure portal by offering self-help for database administration. This makes it easier for developers and database administrators to manage their databases, troubleshoot issues, and optimize performance.

This article provides an overview of Microsoft Copilot in Azure with Azure SQL Database, including its features, how it works, and best practices for effective use.

## How Copilot works in Azure SQL Database

Microsoft Copilot in Azure is now integrated with Azure SQL Database.

Copilot in Azure SQL Database uses large language models (LLMs) to analyze the context of your database and provide relevant answers to your questions. It applies various data sources, including public documentation, dynamic management views, catalog views, and Azure supportability diagnostics, to generate applicable responses. This allows users to ask questions in natural language and receive detailed explanations and suggestions for their database-related queries.

## Features of Copilot in Azure SQL Database

Copilot provides relevant answers to user questions, simplifying database management by applying database context, documentation, dynamic management views, Query Store, and other knowledge sources.

For example:

- Database administrators can independently manage databases and resolve issues, or learn more about the performance and capabilities of your database.

- Developers can ask questions about their data as they would in text or conversation to generate a T-SQL query. Developers can also learn to write queries faster through detailed explanations of the generated query.

- **Microsoft Copilot in Azure integration**: This experience adds Azure SQL Database skills into Microsoft Copilot in Azure, customers with self-guided assistance, empowering them to manage their databases and solve issues independently.

- Copilot integrates data and formulates applicable responses using public documentation, dynamic management views, catalog views, and Azure supportability diagnostics.

## Enable Copilot in your Azure tenant

## Best practices for using Copilot in Azure SQL Database

You can ask and receive helpful, context-rich suggestions from [Microsoft Copilot in Azure](/azure/copilot/overview) within the Azure portal.

Consider the Azure SQL database you're working with and the context of your question. The more specific you are, the better the responses can be. For example, if you ask about a specific database, Copilot provides information relevant to that database.

Additionally, if you're asking Copilot a question about a different database from the database service or page you are on, the result isn't clear and is more likely to give you a bad output.

## Example prompts

The following example prompts are clear, specific, and tailored to the properties of your schema and database.

You can provide prompts for the **Microsoft Copilot in Azure** around different capability areas.

  ```copilot-prompt
    - What service tier should I use for this database?
    - Which connection string should I use to connect to my database?
    - Why was my database unavailable?
  ```
