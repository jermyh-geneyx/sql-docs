## Preview

The following table lists the features of Azure SQL Database that are currently in preview.

> [!NOTE]  
> Features currently in preview are available under [supplemental terms of use](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/preview-supplemental-terms/), review for legal terms that apply to Azure features that are in beta, preview, or otherwise not yet released into general availability. Azure SQL Database provides previews to give you a chance to evaluate and [share feedback with the product group](https://feedback.azure.com/d365community/forum/ef2b2b38-2f25-ec11-b6e6-000d3a4f0f84) on features before they become generally available (GA).

| Feature | Details |
| --- | --- |
| **ABORT_QUERY_EXECUTION** | The new `ABORT_QUERY_EXECUTION` [query hint](/sql/t-sql/queries/hints-transact-sql-query?view=azuresqldb-current&preserve-view=true#use_hint_abort_query_execution), currently in preview, can block future execution of known problematic queries, for example nonessential queries causing high resource consumption and impacting critical application workloads. For more information, see [Query Store hints: Block future execution of problematic queries](/sql/relational-databases/performance/query-store-hints-best-practices?view=azuresqldb-current&preserve-view=true#block-future-execution-of-problematic-queries).|
| **Approximate or fuzzy string matching**| Check if two strings are similar, and calculate the difference between two strings. Use this capability to identify strings that might be different because of character corruption. [What is fuzzy string matching?](/sql/relational-databases/fuzzy-string-match/overview)|
