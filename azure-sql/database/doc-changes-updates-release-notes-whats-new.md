## Preview

The following table lists the features of Azure SQL Database that are currently in preview.

> [!NOTE]  
> Features currently in preview are available under [supplemental terms of use](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/preview-supplemental-terms/), review for legal terms that apply to Azure features that are in beta, preview, or otherwise not yet released into general availability. Azure SQL Database provides previews to give you a chance to evaluate and [share feedback with the product group](https://feedback.azure.com/d365community/forum/ef2b2b38-2f25-ec11-b6e6-000d3a4f0f84) on features before they become generally available (GA).

| Feature | Details |
| --- | --- |
| **Availability metric**| Availability is now a metric in the Azure Monitor metrics. Driven by a variety of user connection failures, you can [monitor and configure alerts on Azure SQL Database Availability](monitoring-metrics-alerts.md#availability-metric). |
| **Copilot skills in Azure SQL Database** | Microsoft Copilot skills in Azure SQL Database include two Azure portal experiences: [Natural language to SQL](../copilot/query-editor-natural-language-to-sql-copilot.md) within the [Azure portal query editor](query-editor.md), and [Azure Copilot integration](../copilot/copilot-azure-sql-overview.md#microsoft-copilot-in-azure-enhanced-scenarios). |
| **Database watcher for Azure SQL** |[Database watcher](../database-watcher-overview.md) is a managed monitoring solution for database services in the Azure SQL family. Database watcher collects in-depth workload monitoring data to give you a detailed view of database performance, configuration, and health. Learn more about [database watcher](https://aka.ms/dbwatcher-preview-announcement). |
| **Degrees of Parallelism (DOP) feedback** | [DOP Feedback](/sql/relational-databases/performance/intelligent-query-processing-degree-parallelism-feedback) is currently available as a limited preview.

| **Network Security Perimeter** | [Azure Network Security Perimeter](network-security-perimeter.md) allows organizations to define a logical network isolation boundary for PaaS resources (for example, Azure Storage and SQL Database) that are deployed outside your organization's virtual networks. It restricts public network access to PaaS resources outside of the perimeter, and access can be exempted by using explicit access rules for public inbound and outbound. |
| **Query editor in the Azure portal** | The [query editor in the Azure portal](query-editor.md) allows you to run queries against your Azure SQL Database directly from a web browser. |
| **UNISTR (Transact-SQL)** | Azure SQL Database now supports the `UNISTR` T-SQL syntax for Unicode string literals. For more information, see [UNISTR (Transact-SQL)](/sql/t-sql/functions/unistr-transact-sql).|
