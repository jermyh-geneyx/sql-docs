# Connect to SQL Database using C and C++

[!INCLUDE[appliesto-sqldb](../includes/appliesto-sqldb.md)]

This article helps C and C++ developers connect to [Azure SQL Database](sql-database-paas-overview.md). 

## Prerequisites

To complete the steps in this guide, you need the following: 

- An active Azure account. If you don't have one, you can sign up for a [Free Azure Trial](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/free-trial/).
- [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads). You must install the C++ language components to build and run this sample.
- [Visual Studio Linux Development](/cpp/linux/). If you are developing on Linux, you must also install the Visual Studio Linux extension.

## Data access technologies: ODBC and OLE DB

There are currently two ways to connect to Azure SQL Database: ODBC (Open Database Connectivity) and OLE DB (Object Linking and Embedding database). In recent years, Microsoft has aligned with [ODBC for native relational data access](/archive/blogs/sqlnativeclient/microsoft-is-aligning-with-odbc-for-native-relational-data-access). ODBC is much faster than OLE DB. The only caveat here is that ODBC does use an old C-style API.

## Create your Azure SQL Database

See the [getting started page](single-database-create-quickstart.md) to learn how to create a sample database.

## Get connection string

After your Azure SQL Database has been provisioned, you need to carry out the following steps to determine connection information and add your client IP for firewall access.

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/), go to your Azure SQL Database **Connection strings** by using the **Show database connection strings** listed as a part of the **Overview** section for your database:

   :::image type="content" source="media/develop-cplusplus-simple/show-database-connection-strings.png" alt-text="Screenshot from the Azure portal of a SQL database Overview page. The show database connection strings link is highlighted.":::

1. Select the **ODBC** tab. 

   :::image type="content" source="media/develop-cplusplus-simple/odbc-connection-string.png" alt-text="Screenshot from the Azure portal of an ODBC Connection String.":::

1. Copy the contents of the **ODBC (Includes Node.js) [SQL authentication]** string. We use this string later to connect from our C++ ODBC command-line interpreter. This string provides details such as the driver, server, and other database connection parameters.

## Add your IP to the firewall

1. Go to your [Azure SQL Database logical server](logical-servers.md). Select the link for **Server name** on the **Overview** page of your SQL database or navigate to it through the Azure portal search.
1. Under **Security**, select **Networking**.
1. Under the **Public access** tab, select **Selected networks** if not already. 
1. Add your [client IP to the firewall using these steps](firewall-configure.md) to make sure we can establish a successful connection. Select **Add your client IPv4 address** or add a firewall rule. 

At this point, you have configured your Azure SQL Database and are ready to connect from your C++ code from your workstation.

> [!TIP]
> Adding your client's workstation IP to the public network firewall is acceptable for a temporary lab or learning setup but for an enterprise solution or long-lived project, follow these [Security best practices](security-best-practice.md):
>
> - Set **Allow Azure services and resources to access this server** to OFF at the server-level.
> - Use VNet Service endpoints and VNet Firewall Rules.
> - Use Private Link.

## Connect from a Windows C/C++ application

You can easily connect to your [Azure SQL Database using ODBC on Windows using this sample](https://github.com/Microsoft/VCSamples/tree/master/VC2015Samples/ODBC%20database%20sample%20%28windows%29) that builds with Visual Studio. The sample implements an ODBC command-line interpreter that can be used to connect to our Azure SQL Database. This sample takes either a Database source name file (DSN) file as a command-line argument or the verbose connection string that we copied earlier from the Azure portal. Bring up the property page for this project and paste the connection string as a command argument as shown here:

:::image type="content" source="media/develop-cplusplus-simple/props.png" alt-text="DSN Propsfile.":::

Make sure you provide the right authentication details for your database as a part of that database connection string.

Launch the application to build it. You should see the following window validating a successful connection. You can even run some basic SQL commands like `CREATE TABLE` to validate your database connectivity:

:::image type="content" source="media/develop-cplusplus-simple/sql-commands.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the C++ connections in odbcsql.exe." lightbox="media/develop-cplusplus-simple/sql-commands.png":::

Alternatively, you could create a DSN file using the wizard that is launched when no command arguments are provided. We recommend that you try this option as well. You can use this DSN file for automation and protecting your authentication settings:

Congratulations! You have now successfully connected to Azure SQL using C++ and ODBC on Windows. You can continue reading to do the same for Linux platform as well.

## Connect from a Linux C/C++ application

You can develop C++ Linux applications in Visual Studio. To learn more, review the following blog: [Visual C++ for Linux Development](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/linux-development-with-c-in-visual-studio/). 

To build for Linux, you need a remote machine where your Linux distro is running. If you don't have one available, you can set one up quickly using [Linux Azure Virtual machines](/azure/virtual-machines/linux/quick-create-cli?toc=/azure/virtual-machines/linux/toc.json) and a variety of deployment methods.

This guide assumes you have an Ubuntu 16.04 Linux distribution set up. The steps also apply to Ubuntu 15.10, Red Hat 6, and Red Hat 7.

The following steps install the libraries needed for SQL and ODBC for your distro:

```console
    sudo su
    sh -c 'echo "deb [arch=amd64] https://apt-mo.trafficmanager.net/repos/mssql-ubuntu-test/ xenial main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/mssqlpreview.list'
    sudo apt-key adv --keyserver apt-mo.trafficmanager.net --recv-keys 417A0893
    apt-get update
    apt-get install msodbcsql
    apt-get install unixodbc-dev-utf16 #this step is optional but recommended*
```

Launch Visual Studio. Under **Tools** -> **Options** -> **Cross Platform**-> **Connection Manager**, add a connection to your Linux box:

:::image type="content" source="media/develop-cplusplus-simple/tools.png" alt-text="Screenshot from Tools Options to create and remove SSH connections.":::

After connection over SSH is established, create an Empty project (Linux) template:

:::image type="content" source="media/develop-cplusplus-simple/template.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the templates for new projects.":::

You can then add a [new C source file and replace it with this content](https://github.com/Microsoft/VCSamples/blob/master/VC2015Samples/ODBC%20database%20sample%20%28linux%29/odbcconnector/odbcconnector.c). Using the ODBC APIs `SQLAllocHandle`, `SQLSetConnectAttr`, and `SQLDriverConnect`, you should be able to initialize and establish a connection to your database.

Like with the Windows ODBC sample, you need to replace the `SQLDriverConnect` call with the details from your database connection string parameters copied from the Azure portal previously.

```c
     retcode = SQLDriverConnect(
        hdbc, NULL, "Driver=ODBC Driver 13 for SQL"
                    "Server;Server=<yourserver>;Uid=<yourusername>;Pwd="
                    "<password>;database=<yourdatabase>",
        SQL_NTS, outstr, sizeof(outstr), &outstrlen, SQL_DRIVER_NOPROMPT);
```

The last thing to do before compiling is to add **odbc** as a library dependency:

:::image type="content" source="media/develop-cplusplus-simple/library-dependencies.png" alt-text="Screenshot of adding ODBC as an input library." lightbox="media/develop-cplusplus-simple/library-dependencies.png":::

To launch your application, bring up the Linux Console from the **Debug** menu:

:::image type="content" source="media/develop-cplusplus-simple/linux-console.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Linux Console menu option.":::

If your connection was successful, you should now see the current database name printed in the Linux Console:

:::image type="content" source="media/develop-cplusplus-simple/linux-console-window.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Linux Console Window Output.":::

Congratulations! You have successfully completed the guide and can now connect to your Azure SQL Database from C++ on Windows and Linux platforms.
