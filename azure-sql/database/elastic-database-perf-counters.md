# Create performance counters to track performance of shard map manager

[!INCLUDE[appliesto-sqldb](../includes/appliesto-sqldb.md)]

Performance counters are used to track the performance of [data dependent routing](elastic-scale-data-dependent-routing.md) operations. These counters are accessible in the **Performance Monitor**, in the "Elastic Database: Shard Management" category.

You can capture the performance of a [shard map manager](elastic-scale-shard-map-management.md), especially when using [data dependent routing](elastic-scale-data-dependent-routing.md). Counters are created with methods of the `Microsoft.Azure.SqlDatabase.ElasticScale.Client` class.  

**For the latest version:** Go to [Microsoft.Azure.SqlDatabase.ElasticScale.Client](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Azure.SqlDatabase.ElasticScale.Client/). See also [Upgrade an app to use the latest elastic database client library](elastic-scale-upgrade-client-library.md).

## Prerequisites

- To create the performance category and counters, the user must be a part of the local **Administrators** group on the machine hosting the application.  
- To create a performance counter instance and update the counters, the user must be a member of either the **Administrators** or **Performance Monitor Users** group.

## Create performance category and counters

To create the counters, call the CreatePerformanceCategoryAndCounters method of the [ShardMapManagementFactory class](/dotnet/api/microsoft.azure.sqldatabase.elasticscale.shardmanagement.shardmapmanagerfactory). Only an administrator can execute the method: `ShardMapManagerFactory.CreatePerformanceCategoryAndCounters()`.

The method creates the following performance counters:

- **Cached mappings**: Number of mappings cached for the shard map.
- **DDR operations/sec**: Rate of data dependent routing operations for the shard map. This counter is updated when a call to [OpenConnectionForKey()](/dotnet/api/microsoft.azure.sqldatabase.elasticscale.shardmanagement.shardmap.openconnectionforkey) results in a successful connection to the destination shard.
- **Mapping lookup cache hits/sec**: Rate of successful cache lookup operations for mappings in the shard map.
- **Mapping lookup cache misses/sec**: Rate of failed cache lookup operations for mappings in the shard map.
- **Mappings added or updated in cache/sec**: Rate at which mappings are being added or updated in cache for the shard map.
- **Mappings removed from cache/sec**: Rate at which mappings are being removed from cache for the shard map.

Performance counters are created for each cached shard map per process.  

## Notes

The following events trigger the creation of the performance counters:  

- Initialization of the [ShardMapManager](/dotnet/api/microsoft.azure.sqldatabase.elasticscale.shardmanagement.shardmapmanager) with [eager loading](/dotnet/api/microsoft.azure.sqldatabase.elasticscale.shardmanagement.shardmapmanagerloadpolicy), if the ShardMapManager contains any shard maps. These include the [GetSqlShardMapManager](/dotnet/api/microsoft.azure.sqldatabase.elasticscale.shardmanagement.shardmapmanagerfactory.getsqlshardmapmanager) and the [TryGetSqlShardMapManager](/dotnet/api/microsoft.azure.sqldatabase.elasticscale.shardmanagement.shardmapmanagerfactory.trygetsqlshardmapmanager) methods.
- Successful lookup of a shard map (using [GetShardMap()](/previous-versions/azure/dn824215(v=azure.100)), [GetListShardMap()](/previous-versions/azure/dn824212(v=azure.100)) or [GetRangeShardMap()](/previous-versions/azure/dn824173(v=azure.100))).
- Successful creation of shard map using `CreateShardMap()`.

The performance counters will be updated by all cache operations performed on the shard map and mappings. Successful removal of the shard map using `DeleteShardMap()` results in deletion of the performance counters instance.  

## Best practices

- Creation of the performance category and counters should be performed only once before the creation of ShardMapManager object. Every execution of the command `CreatePerformanceCategoryAndCounters()` clears the previous counters (losing data reported by all instances) and creates new ones.  
- Performance counter instances are created per process. Any application crash or removal of a shard map from the cache will result in deletion of the performance counters instances.
