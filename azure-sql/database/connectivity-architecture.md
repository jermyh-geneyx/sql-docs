# Connectivity architecture

[!INCLUDE [appliesto-sqldb-fabricsqldb](../includes/appliesto-sqldb-fabricsqldb.md)]

This article explains architecture of various components that direct network traffic to a server in Azure SQL Database and SQL database in Microsoft Fabric. Learn more about different connection policies and how they impact clients connecting from within Azure and clients connecting from outside of Azure.

## Connectivity architecture

The following diagram provides a high-level overview of the connectivity architecture.

The following steps describe how a connection is established:

- Clients connect to the gateway that has a public IP address and listens on port 1433.
- Depending on the effective connection policy, the gateway redirects or proxies the traffic to the correct database cluster.
- Inside the database cluster, traffic is forwarded to the appropriate database.

## Connection policy

Logical SQL servers support the following three options for the server's connection policy setting. 

- **Redirect (recommended):** Clients establish connections directly to the node hosting the database, leading to reduced latency and improved throughput. For connections to use this mode, clients need to:
   - Allow outbound communication from the client to all Azure SQL IP addresses in the region on ports in the range of 11000 to 11999. Use the Service Tags for SQL to make this easier to manage. If you are using Private Link, see [Use Redirect connection policy with private endpoints](private-endpoint-overview.md#use-redirect-connection-policy-with-private-endpoints) for the port ranges to allow.
   - Allow outbound communication from the client to Azure SQL Database gateway IP addresses on port 1433.
   - When using the Redirect connection policy, refer to the [Azure IP Ranges and Service Tags – Public Cloud](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=56519) for a list of your region's IP addresses to allow.
- **Proxy:** In this mode, all connections are proxied via the Azure SQL Database gateways, leading to increased latency and reduced throughput. For connections to use this mode, clients need to allow outbound communication from the client to Azure SQL Database gateway IP addresses on port 1433.
   - When using the Proxy connection policy, refer to the [Gateway IP addresses](#gateway-ip-addresses) list later in this article for your region's IP addresses to allow.
- **Default:** This is the connection policy in effect on all servers after creation unless you explicitly alter the connection policy to either `Proxy` or `Redirect`. The default policy is:
   - `Redirect` for all client connections originating inside of Azure (for example, from an Azure Virtual Machine). 
   - `Proxy` for all client connections originating outside (for example, connections from your local workstation).
   - Currently, the connection policy for [SQL database in Microsoft Fabric](/fabric/database/sql/limitations#connection-policy) is **default** and cannot be changed.

We highly recommend the `Redirect` connection policy over the `Proxy` connection policy for the lowest latency and highest throughput. However, you need to meet the extra requirements for allowing network traffic for outbound communication:

- If the client is an Azure Virtual Machine, you can accomplish this using Network Security Groups (NSG) with [service tags](/azure/virtual-network/network-security-groups-overview#service-tags). 
- If the client is connecting from a workstation on-premises, you might need to work with your network admin to allow network traffic through your corporate firewall.

To change the connection policy, see [Change the connection policy](connectivity-settings.md#change-the-connection-policy).

## Connectivity from within Azure

If you're connecting from within Azure your connections have a connection policy of `Redirect` by default. A policy of `Redirect` means that after the TCP session is established, the client session is then redirected to the right database cluster with a change to the destination virtual IP from that of the Azure SQL Database gateway to that of the cluster. Thereafter, all subsequent packets flow directly to the cluster, bypassing the gateway. The following diagram illustrates this traffic flow.

## Connectivity from outside of Azure

If you're connecting from outside Azure, your connections have a connection policy of `Proxy` by default. A policy of `Proxy` means that the TCP session is established via the Azure SQL Database gateway and all subsequent packets flow via the gateway. The following diagram illustrates this traffic flow.
