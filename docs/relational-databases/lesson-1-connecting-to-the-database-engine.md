# Lesson 1: Connecting to the Database Engine

[!INCLUDE [sqlserver](../includes/applies-to-version/sqlserver.md)]

When you install the [!INCLUDE [ssDEnoversion](../includes/ssdenoversion-md.md)], the tools that are installed depend upon the edition and your setup choices. This lesson describes the principal tools, demonstrating how to connect to the Database Engine and perform an essential function (authorizing more users).

In this lesson, learn the following: 

- [Tools to get started](#tools)
- [Connecting with Management Studio](#connect)
- [Authorizing extra connections](#additional)

<a id="tools"></a>

## Tools for getting started

The [!INCLUDE [ssDEnoversion](../includes/ssdenoversion-md.md)] ships with various tools. This article describes the first tools you need and helps you select the right tool for a job. All tools can be accessed from the **Start** menu. Some tools, such as [SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)](../ssms/download-sql-server-management-studio-ssms.md), aren't installed by default. Select the tools that you want as components during setup. [!INCLUDE [ssExpress](../includes/ssexpress-md.md)] contains only a subset of the tools.

### Common tools

The following table describes some of the more common tools.

| Tool | Type | Operating system |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **[SSMS](../ssms/sql-server-management-studio-ssms.md)** | GUI | Windows |
| **[Azure Data Studio](/azure-data-studio/what-is-azure-data-studio)** | GUI | Windows, macOS, Linux |
| **[bcp](../tools/bcp-utility.md)** | CLI | Windows, macOS, Linux |
| **[sqlcmd](../tools/sqlcmd/sqlcmd-utility.md)** | CLI | Windows, macOS, Linux |

This article focuses on connecting via SSMS. If you're interested in connecting via Azure Data Studio, see [Quickstart: Use Azure Data Studio to connect and query SQL Server](/azure-data-studio/quickstart-sql-server).

### Sample database

[!INCLUDE [article-uses-adventureworks](../includes/article-uses-adventureworks.md)]

#### SSMS (Windows only)

- On current versions of Windows, on the **Start** page, enter **SSMS**, and then select **SQL Server Management Studio**.
- On the **Start** menu of older versions of Windows, point to **All Programs**, point to [!INCLUDE [ssCurrentUI](../includes/sscurrentui-md.md)], and then select **SQL Server Management Studio**.

<a id="connect"></a>

## Connect with SSMS

It's easy to connect to the [!INCLUDE [ssDE](../includes/ssde-md.md)] from tools that are running on the same computer that hosts SQL Server if you know the name of the instance and if you're connecting as a member of the local Administrators group on the computer. The following procedures must be performed on the same computer that hosts SQL Server.

> [!NOTE]  
> This article discusses connecting to an on-premises SQL Server. For Azure SQL Database, see [Connect to Azure SQL Database](../sql-server/connect-to-database-engine.md#connect-to-azure-sql).

#### Determine the name of the instance of the Database Engine

1. Sign in to Windows as a member of the Administrators group, and open [!INCLUDE [ssManStudio](../includes/ssmanstudio-md.md)].

1. In the **Connect to Server** dialog, select **Cancel**.

1. If Registered Servers isn't displayed, on the **View** menu, select **Registered Servers**.

1. With **Database Engine** selected on the Registered Servers toolbar, expand **Database Engine**, right-click **Local Server Groups**, point to **Tasks**, and then select **Register Local Servers**. Expand **Local Server Groups** to see all the instances of the [!INCLUDE [ssDE](../includes/ssde-md.md)] installed on the computer. The default instance is unnamed and is shown as the computer name. A named instance displays as the computer name followed by a backward slash (\\) and then the instance's name. For [!INCLUDE [ssExpress](../includes/ssexpress-md.md)], the instance is named *<computer_name>*\sqlexpress unless the name was changed during setup.

#### Verify that the Database Engine is running

- In Registered Servers, if the name of your instance of SQL Server has a green dot with a white arrow next to the name, the [!INCLUDE [ssDE](../includes/ssde-md.md)] is running and no further action is necessary.

- If the name of your instance of SQL Server has a red dot with a white square next to the name, the [!INCLUDE [ssDE](../includes/ssde-md.md)] is stopped. Right-click the name of the [!INCLUDE [ssDE](../includes/ssde-md.md)], select **Service Control**, and then select **Start**. After a confirmation dialog box, the [!INCLUDE [ssDE](../includes/ssde-md.md)] should start, and the circle should turn green with a white arrow.

#### Connect to the Database Engine

At least one administrator account was selected when [!INCLUDE [ssNoVersion_md](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] was installed. Perform the following steps while signed in to Windows as an administrator.

1. In [!INCLUDE [ssManStudio](../includes/ssmanstudio-md.md)], on the **File** menu, select **Connect Object Explorer**.

   The **Connect to Server** dialog opens. The **Server type** box displays the type of component that was last used.

1. Select **Database Engine**.

1. In the **Server name** box, enter the name of the instance of the Database Engine. For the default instance of SQL Server, the server name is the computer name. The server name for a named instance of SQL Server is *\<computer_name\>***\\***\<instance_name\>*. For example, **ACCTG_SRVR\SQLEXPRESS**. The following screenshot shows the options for connecting to the default (unnamed) instance of [!INCLUDE [ssNoVersion_md](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] on a computer named `PracticeComputer`. The user signed in to Windows is Mary from the Contoso domain. When using Windows Authentication, you can't change the user name.

1. Select **Connect**.

> [!NOTE]  
> This article is written with the assumption that you're new to [!INCLUDE [ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] and have no problems connecting.

## Authorize extra connections

Now that you're connected to SQL Server as an administrator, one of your first tasks is authorizing other users to connect. You authorize users by creating a login and authorizing that login to access a database as a user. You can create logins by using Windows Authentication, SQL Server authentication, or Microsoft Entra authentication. Windows Authentication logins use credentials from Windows. SQL Server authentication logins store the authentication information in SQL Server and are independent of your Windows credentials. Logins from Microsoft Entra ID ([formerly Azure Active Directory](/entra/fundamentals/new-name)) use credentials from cloud-based identities. For more information about this method, see [Microsoft Entra authentication for SQL Server](security/authentication-access/azure-ad-authentication-sql-server-overview.md)

Use Windows Authentication, or Microsoft Entra authentication whenever possible.

> [!TIP]  
> Most organizations have domain users and use Windows Authentication. You can experiment by creating additional local users on your computer. Your computer authenticates local users, so the domain is the computer name. For example, if your computer is named `MyComputer` and you create a user named `Test`, the Windows description of the user is `Mycomputer\Test`.

#### Create a Windows Authentication login

1. In the previous task, you connected to the [!INCLUDE [ssDE](../includes/ssde-md.md)] by using [!INCLUDE [ssManStudio](../includes/ssmanstudio-md.md)]. In Object Explorer, expand your server instance, expand **Security**, right-click **Logins**, and then select **New Login**. The **Login - New** dialog appears.

1. On the **General** page, in the **Login name** box, enter a Windows login in the format `<domain>\<login>`.

   :::image type="content" source="media/lesson-1-connecting-to-the-database-engine/new-login.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Login - New dialog. The Login name box is highlighted.":::

1. In the **Default database** box, select the AdventureWorks database if it's available. Otherwise, select the `master` database.

1. On the **Server Roles** page, if the new login is to be an administrator, select **sysadmin**. Otherwise, leave this blank.

1. On the **User Mapping** page, select **Map** for the [!INCLUDE [ssSampleDBobject](../includes/sssampledbobject-md.md)] database if it's available. Otherwise, select `master`. The **User** box is populated with the login. When the dialog is closed, the user is created in the database.

1. In the **Default Schema** box, enter **dbo** to map the login to the database owner schema.

1. Accept the default settings for the **Securables** and **Status** boxes, and then select **OK** to create the login.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> This section provides basic information to get you started. SQL Server provides a rich security environment.
