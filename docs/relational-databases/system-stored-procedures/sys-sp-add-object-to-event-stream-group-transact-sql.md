# sys.sp_add_object_to_event_stream_group (Transact-SQL)

[!INCLUDE [sqlserver2025](../../includes/applies-to-version/sqlserver2025.md)]

Adds an object (that is, a table) to the stream group for the [change event streaming (CES)](../track-changes/change-event-streaming/overview.md) feature introduced in [!INCLUDE [sssql25-md](../../includes/sssql25-md.md)]. 

> [!NOTE]
> Change event streaming is currently in **preview** for SQL Server 2025.

## Syntax

```syntaxsql
sp_add_object_to_event_stream_group
	[ @stream_group_name = ] N'stream_group_name'
	, [ @object_name ] = N'schema_name_dot_object_name'
	[ , [ @include_all_columns ] = include_all_columns ]
	[ , [ @include_old_values ] = include_old_values ]
	[ , [ @include_old_lob_values] = include_old_lob_values ]
```

## Arguments

#### [ @stream_group_name = ] N'stream_group_name' 

Specifies the name of the event stream group you want to add the table to. *@stream_group_name* is **sysname**, and can't be `NULL`.

#### [ @object_name ] = N'schema_name_dot_object_name'

Specifies the name of the table you want to stream as part of the specified stream group. *@object_name* is **nvarchar(512)**, and can't be `NULL`. 

Use a two-part name for the column that includes both the schema name and column name. For example, a valid value is `dbo.Addresses`.

#### [ @include_all_columns ] = include_all_columns

Defines what columns to include within the payload of the message that streams the changes made to the specified table. *@include_all_columns* is **bit**, and can't be `NULL`.  

*@include_all_columns* can be one of the following values:

| Value | Description |
|---|---|
| `1` (default) | Includes all columns within the payload of the message that streams the changes made to the specified table.  |
| `0` | Only includes columns that have changed within the payload of the message that streams the changes made to the specified table. |

#### [ @include_old_values ] = include_old_values

If specified, determines if old values are included within the payload of the message that streams the changes made to the specified table. *@include_old_values* is **bit**, and can't be `NULL`. This parameter is optional. 

Old values are the values of the column before the change was made. For example, if a row is updated, the old values are the values of the columns before the update. 

*@include_old_values* can be one of the following:

| Value | Description |
|---|---|
| `1` (default) | Includes old values within the payload of the message that streams the changes made to the specified table.  |
| `0` | Skips old values within the payload of the message that streams the changes made to the specified table. |

#### [ @include_old_lob_values] = include_old_lob_values

Determines if old changed large objects (LOB) values are included within the payload of the message that streams the changes made to the specified table. '@include_old_lob_values* is **bit**, and can't be `NULL`. 

Old values are the values of the column before the change was made. For example, if a row is updated, the old values are the values of the columns before the update. 

'@include_old_lob_values* can be one of the following values:

| Value | Description |
|---|---|
| `1` | Includes all columns within the payload of the message that streams the changes made to the specified table.  |
| `0` (default) | Only includes columns that have changed within the payload of the message that streams the changes made to the specified table. |

## Return code values

`0` (success) or `1` (failure).

## Permissions

A user with [CONTROL database permissions](../security/permissions-database-engine.md), **db_owner** database role membership, or **sysadmin** server role membership can execute this procedure.
