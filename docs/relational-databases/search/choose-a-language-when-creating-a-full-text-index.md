# Choose a language when creating a full-text index

[!INCLUDE [SQL Server Azure SQL Database](../../includes/applies-to-version/sql-asdb.md)]

When creating a full-text index, you need to specify a column-level language for the indexed column. The [word breaker and stemmers](configure-and-manage-word-breakers-and-stemmers-for-search.md) of the specified language are used by full-text queries on the column. There are a couple of things to consider when choosing the column language when creating a full-text index. These considerations relate to how your text is tokenized, and then indexed by, the Full-Text Engine.

> [!NOTE]  
> To specify a column-level language for a column of full-text index, use the `LANGUAGE <language_term>` clause when specifying the column. For more information, see [CREATE FULLTEXT INDEX](../../t-sql/statements/create-fulltext-index-transact-sql.md) and [ALTER FULLTEXT INDEX](../../t-sql/statements/alter-fulltext-index-transact-sql.md).

## Language support in Full-Text Search

This section provides an introduction to word breakers and stemmers, and discusses how Full-Text Search uses the language code identifier (LCID) of the column-level language.

### Introduction to word breakers and stemmers

[!INCLUDE [ssnoversion-md](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] include a complete family of word breakers and stemmers. The Microsoft Natural Language Group (NLG) implements and supports these linguistic components.

The word breakers provide the following benefits:

- Robustness

  Testing shows that the word breakers are robust in high-pressure query environments.

- Security

  The word breakers are enabled by default in SQL Server. We highly recommend that external components such as word breakers and filters be signed to improve the overall security and robustness of SQL Server. You can configure full-text to verify that these components are signed as follows:

  ```sql
  EXECUTE sp_fulltext_service 'verify_signature';
  ```

- Quality

  Internal testing shows that the word breakers provide better semantic quality than previous word breakers. This increases the recall accuracy.

- Coverage for a vast list of languages, word breakers are included in SQL Server out of the box and enabled by default.

For a list of the languages for which SQL Server includes a word breaker and stemmers, see [sys.fulltext_languages](../system-catalog-views/sys-fulltext-languages-transact-sql.md).

### How Full-Text Search uses the name of the column-level language

When creating a full-text index, you need to specify a valid language name for each column. If a language name is valid but not returned by the [sys.fulltext_languages](../system-catalog-views/sys-fulltext-languages-transact-sql.md) catalog view, Full-Text Search falls back to the closest available language name of the same language family, if any. Otherwise, Full-Text Search falls back to the Neutral word breaker. This fall-back behavior might affect the recall accuracy. Therefore we strongly recommend that you specify a valid and available language name for each column when creating a full-text index.

> [!NOTE]  
> The LCID is used against all data types eligible for full-text indexing (such as **char** or **nchar**). If you have the sort order of a **char**, **varchar**, or **text** type column set to a language setting different from the language identified by the LCID, the LCID is used anyway during full-text indexing and querying of those columns.

## Word breaking

A word breaker tokenizes the text being indexed on word boundaries, which are language-specific. Therefore, word-breaking behavior differs among different languages. If you use one language, `x`, to index several languages {`x`, `y`, and `z`}, some of the behavior might cause unexpected results. For example, a dash (`-`) or a comma (`,`) might be a word-break element that is thrown away in one language but not in another. Also rarely unexpected stemming behavior might occur because a given word might stem differently in different language. For example, in the English language, word boundaries are typically white space or some form of punctuation. In other languages, such as German, words or characters might be combined together. Therefore, the column-level language that you choose should represent the language that you expect to store in rows of that column.
  
### Western languages

For the Western family of languages, if you're unsure which languages are going to be stored in a column, or you expect more than one to be stored, a general workaround is to use the word breaker for the most complex language that might be stored in the column.

For instance, you might expect to store English, Spanish, and German content in a single column. These three Western languages possess similar word-breaking patterns, with the German patterns being the most complex. Therefore, a good choice is this case would be to use the German word breaker, which should be able to process English and Spanish text correctly. In contrast, the English word breaker might not process German text perfectly because of the compound words of German.

Using the word breaker of the most complex language in a language family doesn't guarantee perfect indexing of every language in the family. Corner cases might exist in which the most complex word breaker can't correctly handle text written in another language.
  
### Non Western languages

For non Western languages (such as Chinese, Japanese, Hindi, and so forth) the previous workaround doesn't necessarily work, for linguistic reasons. For non Western languages, consider one of the following workarounds:

- For languages from different families

  If a column might contain dramatically different languages, for example, Spanish and Japanese, consider storing the content of different languages in separate columns. This separation would allow you to use the language-specific word breaker for each column. If you choose this solution and you don't know the query language at query time, you might need to issue the query against both columns to ensure that the query finds the right row or document.

- For Binary content (such as Microsoft Word documents)

  When the indexed content is of **binary** type, the Full-Text Search filter that processes the textual content before sending it to the word breaker might honor specific language tags existing within the binary file. In this case, at indexing time, the filter emits the right LCID for a document or section of a document. The Full-Text Engine then calls the word breaker for the language with that LCID. However, after indexing multi language content, we recommend that you verify that the content was correctly indexed.

- For plain text content

  When your content is plain text, you can convert it to the **xml** data type and add language tags that indicate the language corresponding to each specific document or document section. For this to work, however, you need to know the language before full-text indexing.

## Stemming

Another consideration when choosing your column-level language is *stemming*. Stemming in full-text queries is the process of searching for all stemmed (inflectional) forms of a word in a particular language. When you use a generic word breaker to process several languages, the stemming process works only for the language specified for the column, not for other languages in the column. For example, German stemmers don't work for English or Spanish (and so forth). This might affect your recall depending on which language you choose at query time.

## Effect of column type on Full-Text Search

Another consideration in language choice is related to how the data is represented. For data that isn't stored in a **varbinary(max)** column, no special filtering is performed. Rather, the text is generally passed through the word breaking component as-is.

Also, word breakers are designed mainly to process written text. So, if you have any type of markup (such as HTML) on your text, you might not get great linguistic accuracy during indexing and search. In that case, you have two choices-the preferred method is simply to store the text data in a **varbinary(max)** column, and to indicate its document type so it might be filtered. If this isn't an option, you might consider using the neutral word breaker and, if possible, adding markup data (such as 'br' in HTML) to your noise word lists.

> [!NOTE]  
> Language based stemming doesn't come into play when you specify the neutral language.

## Specify a non-default column-level language in a full-text query

By default, in [!INCLUDE [ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)], Full-Text Search parses the query terms using the language specified for each column that is included in the full-text clause. To override this behavior, specify a nondefault language at query time. For supported languages whose resources are installed, the `LANGUAGE <language_term>` clause of a [CONTAINS](../../t-sql/queries/contains-transact-sql.md), [CONTAINSTABLE](../system-functions/containstable-transact-sql.md), [FREETEXT](../../t-sql/queries/freetext-transact-sql.md), or [FREETEXTTABLE](../system-functions/freetexttable-transact-sql.md) query can be used to specify the language used for word breaking, stemming, thesaurus, and stopword processing of the query terms.
