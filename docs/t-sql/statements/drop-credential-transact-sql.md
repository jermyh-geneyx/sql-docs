:::image type="icon" source="../../includes/media/topic-link-icon.svg" border="false"::: [Transact-SQL syntax conventions](../../t-sql/language-elements/transact-sql-syntax-conventions-transact-sql.md)

## Syntax

```syntaxsql
DROP CREDENTIAL credential_name
```

## Arguments

#### *credential_name*

The name of the credential to remove from the server.

## Remarks

To drop the secret associated with a credential without dropping the credential itself, use [ALTER CREDENTIAL](alter-credential-transact-sql.md).

Information about credentials is visible in the `sys.credentials` catalog view.

Proxies are associated with a credential. Deleting a credential that is used by a proxy leaves the associated proxy in an unusable state. When dropping a credential used by a proxy, delete the proxy (by using [sp_delete_proxy](../../relational-databases/system-stored-procedures/sp-delete-proxy-transact-sql.md)) and recreate the associated proxy (by using [sp_add_proxy](../../relational-databases/system-stored-procedures/sp-add-proxy-transact-sql.md)).

## Permissions

Requires `ALTER ANY CREDENTIAL` permission. If dropping a system credential, requires `CONTROL SERVER` permission.

## Examples

The following example removes the credential called `Saddles`.

```sql
DROP CREDENTIAL Saddles;
GO
```
