## Syntax

```syntaxsql
DROP RESOURCE POOL pool_name
[ ; ]
```

## Arguments

#### *pool_name*

Is the name of an existing user-defined resource pool.

## Remarks

You can't drop a resource pool if it contains any workload groups.

You can't drop the built-in `default` and `internal` pools.

For more information, see [Resource governor](../../relational-databases/resource-governor/resource-governor.md) and [Resource governor resource pool](../../relational-databases/resource-governor/resource-governor-resource-pool.md).

## Permissions

Requires the `CONTROL SERVER` permission.

## Examples

The following example deletes the resource pool named `big_pool` and makes the new configuration effective.

```sql
DROP RESOURCE POOL big_pool;

ALTER RESOURCE GOVERNOR RECONFIGURE;
```
