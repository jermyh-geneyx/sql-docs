## Syntax

```syntaxsql
DROP WORKLOAD GROUP group_name
[;]
```

## Arguments

#### *group_name*

The name of an existing user-defined workload group.

## Remarks

The `DROP WORKLOAD GROUP` statement is not allowed on the resource governor built-in `internal` and `default` groups.

If a workload group contains active sessions, deleting the workload group fails when the `ALTER RESOURCE GOVERNOR RECONFIGURE` statement is executed to apply the change. To avoid this problem, you can take one of the following actions:

- Wait until all sessions in the affected group disconnect, and then execute the `ALTER RESOURCE GOVERNOR RECONFIGURE` statement.
- Explicitly stop sessions in the affected group by using the [KILL](../../t-sql/language-elements/kill-transact-sql.md) T-SQL command, and then execute the `ALTER RESOURCE GOVERNOR RECONFIGURE` statement. If you decide that you don't want to explicitly stop sessions, re-create the group by using the original name and settings.
- Restart the server. When the server restarts, the deleted group is deleted permanently.

For more information, see [Resource governor](../../relational-databases/resource-governor/resource-governor.md) and [Resource governor workload group](../../relational-databases/resource-governor/resource-governor-workload-group.md).

## Permissions

Requires the `CONTROL SERVER` permission.

## Examples

The following example drops the workload group named `adhoc`.

```sql
DROP WORKLOAD GROUP adhoc;

ALTER RESOURCE GOVERNOR RECONFIGURE;
```
