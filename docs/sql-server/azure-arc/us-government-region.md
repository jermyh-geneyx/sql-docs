# SQL Server enabled by Azure Arc in US Government

This article describes features and limitations currently available for SQL Server enabled by Azure Arc on US Government regions. It also:

- Points to instructions how to on board your SQL Server in US Government regions
- Lists known issues and options to work around the issues

You can use SQL Server enabled by Azure Arc to manage SQL Server Azure Arc resources in US Government regions. View these resources in the Azure Government portal just like any Azure resource. The portal provides a single pane of glass to monitor and organize your SQL Server estate in the government cloud.

Currently, these features are only available:

- In the US Government Virginia region
- On Windows operating system

With SQL Server enabled by Azure Arc, U.S. government agencies and organizations can manage SQL Server instances outside of Azure from the Azure Government portal, in a secure and compliant manner.
