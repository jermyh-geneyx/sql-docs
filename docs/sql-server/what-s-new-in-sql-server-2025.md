With a quick call to the system stored procedure [sp_invoke_external_rest_endpoint](../relational-databases/system-stored-procedures/sp-invoke-external-rest-endpoint-transact-sql.md), you can:<br /><br />- Have data processed via an Azure Function<br />- Update a Power BI dashboard<br />- Call a local, in-house enterprise REST endpoint<br />- Talk to Azure OpenAI Services |
| [JSON data in SQL Server](../relational-databases/json/json-data-sql-server.md#sql-server-2025-changes) | Use SQL Server built-in functions and operators to:<br /><br />- Parse JSON text and read or modify values.<br />- Transform arrays of JSON objects into table format.<br />- Run any Transact-SQL query on the converted JSON objects.<br />- Format the results of Transact-SQL queries in JSON format.<br />- Review examples at: [JSON data type](../t-sql/data-types/json-data-type.md): Store JSON in a native binary format. |
| Batch mode optimizations for built-in functions | Performance improvements for the following built-in functions:<br /><br />- [Mathematical functions](../t-sql/functions/mathematical-functions-transact-sql.md)<br />- [DATETRUNC](../t-sql/functions/datetrunc-transact-sql.md) |
| New Chinese collations | Version 160 to support GB18030-2022 standard. |
