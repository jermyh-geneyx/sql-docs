# How to: Pause Service Broker networking (Transact-SQL)

[!INCLUDE [sql-asdbmi](../../includes/applies-to-version/sql-asdbmi.md)]

Service Broker sends and receives messages over the network while any endpoint for Service Broker is in the `STARTED` state. To pause Service Broker networking, alter all Service Broker endpoints to set the state to `STOPPED`. This state prevents Service Broker from transmitting messages out of the instance, or receiving messages from outside of the instance, but doesn't affect message delivery within the instance. To prevent message delivery to a specific database, use `ALTER DATABASE` to deactivate Service Broker in that database.

## Pause Service Broker networking

- Alter all Service Broker endpoints to set the state to `STOPPED`.

## Examples

```sql
USE master;
GO

ALTER ENDPOINT BrokerEndpoint
    STATE = STOPPED;
GO
```
