# How to: Activate Service Broker message delivery in databases (Transact-SQL)

[!INCLUDE [sql-asdbmi](../../includes/applies-to-version/sql-asdbmi.md)]

By default, Service Broker message delivery is active in a database when the database is created. When message delivery isn't active, messages remain in the transmission queue. To determine whether Service Broker is active for a database, check the `is_broker_enabled` column of the `sys.databases` catalog view.

> [!NOTE]  
> Activating Service Broker allows messages to be delivered to the database. You must create a Service Broker endpoint to send and receive messages from outside of the instance.

## Activate Service Broker in a database

- Alter the database to set the `ENABLE_BROKER` option.

## Examples

```sql
USE master;
GO

ALTER DATABASE AdventureWorks2008R2
    SET ENABLE_BROKER;
GO
```
