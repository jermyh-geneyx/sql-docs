# How to: Activate Service Broker message forwarding (Transact-SQL)

[!INCLUDE [sql-asdbmi](../../includes/applies-to-version/sql-asdbmi.md)]

Message forwarding allows an instance of SQL Server to accept messages from outside the instance and send those messages to a different instance. Message forwarding is configured on a Service Broker endpoint.

## Activate Service Broker message forwarding

1. Activate Service Broker networking if networking isn't already active. For more information on Service Broker networking, see [How to: Activate Service Broker networking](how-to-activate-service-broker-networking-transact-sql.md).

1. Alter the endpoint to activate message forwarding, and specify the maximum size, in megabytes, for forwarded messages.

## Examples

```sql
USE master;
GO

ALTER ENDPOINT BrokerEndpoint FOR SERVICE_BROKER
(
    MESSAGE_FORWARDING = ENABLED,
    MESSAGE_FORWARD_SIZE = 10
);
GO
```
