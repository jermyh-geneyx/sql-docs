# How to: Deactivate Service Broker message forwarding (Transact-SQL)

[!INCLUDE [sql-asdbmi](../../includes/applies-to-version/sql-asdbmi.md)]

Message forwarding allows an instance of SQL Server to accept messages from outside the instance and send those messages to a different instance. Message forwarding is configured on a Service Broker endpoint.

## Deactivate Service Broker message forwarding

- Alter the endpoint to deactivate message forwarding.

## Examples

```sql
USE master;
GO

ALTER ENDPOINT BrokerEndpoint
    FOR SERVICE_BROKER (MESSAGE_FORWARDING = DISABLED);
GO
```
