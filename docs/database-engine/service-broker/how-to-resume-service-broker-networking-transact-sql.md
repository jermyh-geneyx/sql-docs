# How to: Resume Service Broker networking (Transact-SQL)

[!INCLUDE [sql-asdbmi](../../includes/applies-to-version/sql-asdbmi.md)]

Service Broker sends and receives messages over the network while any endpoint for Service Broker is in the `STARTED` state. To resume Service Broker networking, alter the endpoints to set the state to `STARTED`.

> [!NOTE]  
> Activating Service Broker networking allows Service Broker to send and receive messages over the network. The authentication level set on the endpoint controls which network connections the endpoint accepts. For more information on Service Broker networking and security, see [Security Overview (Service Broker)](security-overview.md).

## Resume Service Broker networking

- Alter an endpoint to set the state to `STARTED`.

## Examples

USE master;
GO

    STATE = STARTED;
GO
```
