# Lesson 2: Create an internal activation procedure

[!INCLUDE [sql-asdbmi](../../includes/applies-to-version/sql-asdbmi.md)]

In this lesson, you learn to create a stored procedure to process messages from a Service Broker queue. You also learn how to specify that the procedure is activated anytime there are messages in the queue.

## Procedures

[!INCLUDE [service-broker-adventureworks-2008-r2](../../includes/service-broker-adventureworks-2008-r2.md)]

### Switch to the AdventureWorks database

Copy and paste the following code into a Query Editor window. Then, run it to switch context to the [!INCLUDE [sssampledbobject-md](../../includes/sssampledbobject-md.md)] database.

```sql
USE AdventureWorks2022;
GO
```

### Create an internal activation stored procedure

Copy and paste the following code into a Query Editor window. Then, run it to create a stored procedure. When it runs, the stored procedure keeps receiving messages as long as there are messages in the queue. If the receive times out without returning a message, the stored procedure ends. If the received message was a request message, the stored procedure returns a reply message. If the received message is an `EndDialog` message, the stored procedure ends the target side of the conversation. If the received message is and `Error` message, it rolls back the transaction.

```sql
CREATE PROCEDURE TargetActiveProc
AS
DECLARE @RecvReqDlgHandle AS UNIQUEIDENTIFIER;
DECLARE @RecvReqMsg AS NVARCHAR (100);
DECLARE @RecvReqMsgName AS sysname;
WHILE (1 = 1)
    BEGIN
        BEGIN TRANSACTION;
        WAITFOR (RECEIVE TOP (1) @RecvReqDlgHandle = conversation_handle,
            @RecvReqMsg = message_body, @RecvReqMsgName = message_type_name FROM TargetQueueIntAct),
        TIMEOUT 5000;
        IF (@@ROWCOUNT = 0)
            BEGIN
                ROLLBACK;
                BREAK;
            END
        IF @RecvReqMsgName = N'//AWDB/InternalAct/RequestMessage'
            BEGIN
                DECLARE @ReplyMsg AS NVARCHAR (100);
                SELECT @ReplyMsg = N'<ReplyMsg>Message for Initiator service.</ReplyMsg>';
                SEND ON CONVERSATION (@RecvReqDlgHandle) MESSAGE TYPE [//AWDB/InternalAct/ReplyMessage] (@ReplyMsg);
            END
        ELSE
            IF @RecvReqMsgName = N'https://schemas.microsoft.com/SQL/ServiceBroker/EndDialog'
                BEGIN
                    END CONVERSATION @RecvReqDlgHandle;
                END
            ELSE
            IF @RecvReqMsgName = N'https://schemas.microsoft.com/SQL/ServiceBroker/Error'
                BEGIN
                    END CONVERSATION @RecvReqDlgHandle;
                END
        COMMIT TRANSACTION;
    END
GO
```

### Alter the target queue to specify internal activation

Copy and paste the following code into a Query Editor window. Then, run it to specify that Service Broker activate the `TargetActiveProc` stored procedure to process messages from `TargetQueueIntAct`. Service Broker runs a copy of `TargetActiveProc` anytime a message is received in `TargetQueueIntAct` and no copy of the procedure is already running. Service Broker runs extra copies of `TargetActiveProc` whenever the existing copies don't keep up with the number of incoming messages.

```sql
ALTER QUEUE TargetQueueIntAct
    WITH ACTIVATION (STATUS = ON, PROCEDURE_NAME = TargetActiveProc, MAX_QUEUE_READERS = 10, EXECUTE AS SELF);
GO
```

## Next step

You successfully configured [!INCLUDE [sssampledbobject-md](../../includes/sssampledbobject-md.md)] to support a conversation between the `//AWDB/InternalAct/InitiatorService` and the `//AWDB/InternalAct/TargetService`.
