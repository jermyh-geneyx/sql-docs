# Handle poison messages

[!INCLUDE [sql-asdbmi](../../includes/applies-to-version/sql-asdbmi.md)]

This article describes one way that an application that uses Service Broker can detect a poison message and remove the message from the queue without relying on automatic poison message detection.

Service Broker provides automatic poison message detection. Automatic poison message detection sets the queue status to `OFF` if a transaction that receives messages from the queue rolls back five times. This feature provides a safeguard against catastrophic failures that an application can't detect programmatically. However, an application shouldn't rely on this feature for normal processing. Because automatic poison message detection stops the queue, this feature effectively halts all processing for the application until the poison message is removed. Instead, an application should attempt to detect and remove poison messages as part of the application logic.

The strategy outlined in this section assumes that a message should be removed if it fails a certain number of times. For many applications, this assumption is valid. However, before using this strategy in your application, consider the following questions:

- Is a failure count reliable for your application? Depending on your application, it might be normal for messages to fail from time to time. For example, in an order-entry application, the service that processes an order might take less processing time than the service that adds a new customer record. In this case, it might be normal that an order for a new customer can't be processed immediately. The application needs to account for the delay when deciding whether a message is a poison message or not. The service might need to allow several failures before removing the message.

- Can your application quickly and reliably check the content of a message to detect that it can never succeed? If so, this is a better strategy than counting the number of times that the program failed to process the message. For example, an expense report that doesn't contain an employee name or an employee ID number can't be processed. In this case, the program might be more efficient if it immediately responds to a message that can't be processed with an error, rather than attempting to process the message. Consider other validation as well. For example, if the ID number is present, but falls outside the range of assigned numbers (for example, a negative number), the application can end the conversation immediately.

- Should you remove a message after any failure? If the application handles a high volume of messages where each message has a limited useful life, it might be most efficient to immediately remove any message that causes an operation to fail. For example, if the message provides a progress report from the target service, the initiating service might choose to discard an empty progress report by committing the receive without processing the message. In this case, the conversation continues.

Consider the following questions when you decide how the application handles a poison message:

- Should your application log the failure and the content of the message? In many cases, this isn't necessary. However, for some applications, preserving the content of the message might be appropriate.

- Should your application log other information about the failure? In some cases, you might want to track other information about the conversation. For example, you might use the catalog view `sys.conversation_endpoints` to identify the remote broker instance that generated the poison message.

- Should your application end the conversation with an error, or should the contract for the service allow an application to indicate an error without closing the conversation? For many services, receiving a poison message means that the task described in the contract can't be completed. In this case, the application ends the conversation with an error. In other cases, the conversation might be able to continue even though one message fails. For example, a service that receives inventory data from a warehouse floor might occasionally receive a message with an unknown part number. Rather than ending the conversation, the service might save the message in a separate table for an operator to inspect at a later time.

## Example: Detect a poison message

This Transact-SQL example shows a simple, stateless service that includes logic for handling poison messages. Before the stored procedure receives a message, the procedure saves the transaction. When the procedure can't process a message, the procedure rolls the transaction back to the save point. The partial rollback returns the message to the queue while continuing to hold a lock on the conversation group for the message. Because the program continues to hold the conversation group lock, the program can update a table that maintains a list of failed messages without risk that another queue reader might process the message.

The following example defines the activation stored procedure for the application:

```sql
CREATE PROCEDURE ProcessExpenseReport
AS
BEGIN
    WHILE (1 = 1)
        BEGIN
            BEGIN TRANSACTION;
            DECLARE @conversationHandle AS UNIQUEIDENTIFIER;
            DECLARE @messageBody AS VARBINARY (MAX);
            DECLARE @messageTypeName AS NVARCHAR (256);

            SAVE TRANSACTION UndoReceive;

            WAITFOR (
                RECEIVE TOP (1) @messageTypeName = message_type_name,
                @messageBody = message_body,
                @conversationHandle = conversation_handle
                FROM ExpenseQueue),
            TIMEOUT 500;
            IF @@ROWCOUNT = 0
                BEGIN
                    ROLLBACK;
                    BREAK;
                END

            -- Typical message processing loop: dispatch to a stored
            -- procedure based on the message type name.  End conversation
            -- with an error for unknown message types.

            -- Process expense report messages. If processing fails,
            -- roll back to the save point and track the failed message.
            IF (@messageTypeName = '//Adventure-Works.com/AccountsPayable/ExpenseReport')
                BEGIN
                    DECLARE @expenseReport AS NVARCHAR (MAX);
                    SET @expenseReport = CAST (@messageBody AS NVARCHAR (MAX));
                                        EXECUTE AdventureWorks2008R2.dbo.AddExpenseReport
                        @report = @expenseReport;
                    IF @@ERROR <> 0
                        BEGIN
                            ROLLBACK TRANSACTION UndoReceive;
                            EXECUTE TrackMessage @conversationHandle;
                        END
                    ELSE
                        BEGIN
                            EXECUTE AdventureWorks2008R2.dbo.ClearMessageTracking @conversationHandle;
                        END
                END
            ELSE

            -- For error messages and end dialog messages, end the
            -- conversation.
            IF (@messageTypeName = 'https://schemas.microsoft.com/SQL/ServiceBroker/Error'
                OR @messageTypeName = 'https://schemas.microsoft.com/SQL/ServiceBroker/EndDialog')
                BEGIN
                    END CONVERSATION @conversationHandle;
                    EXECUTE dbo.ClearMessageTracking @conversationHandle;
                END
            COMMIT TRANSACTION;
        END
END
```

The stored procedure `TrackMessage` tracks the number of times that a message has failed. When the message hasn't failed before, the procedure inserts a new counter for the message into the table `ExpenseServiceFailedMessages`. Otherwise, the procedure checks the counter for the number of times that the message failed. The procedure increments the counter when the counter is less than a predefined number. When the counter is greater than the predefined number, the procedure ends the conversation with an error and removes the counter for the conversation from the table.

```sql
CREATE PROCEDURE TrackMessage (
    @conversationHandle UNIQUEIDENTIFIER
)
AS
BEGIN
    IF @conversationHandle IS NULL
        RETURN;
    DECLARE @count AS INT;
    SET @count = NULL;
    SET @count = (SELECT COUNT
                  FROM dbo.ExpenseServiceFailedMessages
                  WHERE conversation_handle = @conversationHandle);
    IF @count IS NULL
        BEGIN
            INSERT INTO dbo.ExpenseServiceFailedMessages (COUNT, conversation_handle)
            VALUES (1, @conversationHandle);
        END
    IF @count > 3
        BEGIN
            EXECUTE dbo.ClearMessageTracking @conversationHandle;
            END CONVERSATION @conversationHandle
                WITH ERROR = 500 DESCRIPTION = 'Unable to process message.';
        END
    ELSE
        BEGIN
            UPDATE dbo.ExpenseServiceFailedMessages
                SET COUNT = COUNT + 1
            WHERE conversation_handle = @conversationHandle;
        END
END
GO
```

The definition of table `ExpenseServiceFailedMessages` simply contains a `conversation_handle` column and a `count` column, as shown in the following sample:

```sql
CREATE TABLE ExpenseServiceFailedMessages
(
    conversation_handle UNIQUEIDENTIFIER PRIMARY KEY,
    COUNT SMALLINT
);
```

The procedure `ClearMessageTracking` deletes the counter for a conversation from the table `ExpenseServiceFailedMessages`, as shown in the following sample:

```sql
CREATE PROCEDURE ClearMessageTracking (
    @conversationHandle UNIQUEIDENTIFIER
)
AS
BEGIN
    DELETE dbo.ExpenseServiceFailedMessages
    WHERE conversation_handle = @conversationHandle;
END
GO
```

The strategy shown here is deliberately simple. You should use the ideas in this topic as a basis for building an application that matches your needs. For example, if your application maintains state, it might be more efficient to include the tracking information for failed messages in the state tables for the application.

The preceding stored procedures don't handle errors that cause a transaction to fail. If this service receives a message that causes the entire transaction to fail, the transaction will roll back. If this happens five times, automatic poison message detection will set the queue status to `OFF`. In this case, the poison message must be removed by a different application or by an administrator.

If you believe that the processing you perform on the message might cause a transaction failure, you can use `TRY` and `CATCH` statements to handle the error.
