# Default SQL Server network protocol configuration

[!INCLUDE [SQL Server](../../includes/applies-to-version/sqlserver.md)]

To enhance security, [!INCLUDE [ssNoVersion_md](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] disables network connectivity for some new installations. Network connectivity using TCP/IP isn't disabled if you're using the Enterprise, Standard, Evaluation, or Workgroup edition, or if a previous installation of [!INCLUDE [ssNoVersion_md](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] is present. For all installations, shared memory protocol is enabled to allow local connections to the server. The [!INCLUDE [ssNoVersion_md](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Browser service might be stopped, depending on installation conditions and installation options.

Use the [!INCLUDE [ssNoVersion_md](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Network Configuration node of [!INCLUDE [ssNoVersion_md](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Configuration Manager to configure the network protocols after installation. Use the [!INCLUDE [ssNoVersion_md](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Services node of [!INCLUDE [ssNoVersion_md](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Configuration Manager to configure the [!INCLUDE [ssNoVersion_md](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Browser service to start automatically. For more information, see [Enable or disable a server network protocol](enable-or-disable-a-server-network-protocol.md).

## Default configuration

The following table describes the configuration after installation.

| Edition | New installation vs. previous installation is present | Shared memory | TCP/IP | Named pipes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Enterprise | New installation | Enabled | Enabled | Disabled for network connections. |
| Standard | New installation | Enabled | Enabled | Disabled for network connections. |
| Web | New installation | Enabled | Enabled | Disabled for network connections. |
| Developer | New installation | Enabled | Disabled | Disabled for network connections. |
| Evaluation | New installation | Enabled | Enabled | Disabled for network connections. |
| SQL Server Express | New installation | Enabled | Disabled | Disabled for network connections. |
| All editions | Previous installation is present but isn't being upgraded. | Same as new installation | Same as new installation | Same as new installation. |
| All editions | Upgrade | Enabled | Settings from the previous installation are preserved. | Settings from the previous installation are preserved. |

If the instance is running on a [!INCLUDE [ssNoVersion_md](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] failover cluster, it listens on those ports on each IP address selected for [!INCLUDE [ssNoVersion_md](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] during [!INCLUDE [ssNoVersion_md](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] setup.

> [!NOTE]  
> When you install [!INCLUDE [ssNoVersion_md](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] with command-prompt arguments, you can specify the protocols to enable by using the `TCPENABLED` and `NPENABLED` parameters. For more information, see [Install and configure SQL Server on Windows from the command prompt](../install-windows/install-sql-server-from-the-command-prompt.md).

## Create a connection string

See the following articles for samples of connection strings:

- [Creating a Valid Connection String Using Shared Memory Protocol](../../tools/configuration-manager/creating-a-valid-connection-string-using-shared-memory-protocol.md)
- [Creating a Valid Connection String Using TCP IP](../../tools/configuration-manager/creating-a-valid-connection-string-using-tcp-ip.md)

## SQL Server Browser settings

The [!INCLUDE [ssNoVersion_md](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Browser service can be configured to start automatically during setup. The default is to start automatically under the following conditions:

- When upgrading an installation.
- When installing side by side with another instance of [!INCLUDE [ssNoVersion_md](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)].
- When installing on a cluster.
- When installing a named instance of the Database Engine including all instances of [!INCLUDE [ssexpress-md](../../includes/ssexpress-md.md)] edition.
- When installing a named instance of Analysis Services.
