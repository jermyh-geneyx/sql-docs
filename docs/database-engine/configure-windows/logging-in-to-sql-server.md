# Sign in to SQL Server

[!INCLUDE [SQL Server](../../includes/applies-to-version/sqlserver.md)]

You can sign in to an instance of [!INCLUDE [ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] by using any of the graphical administration tools or from a command prompt.

When you sign in to an instance of [!INCLUDE [ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] by using a graphical administration tool such as [!INCLUDE [ssManStudioFull](../../includes/ssmanstudiofull-md.md)], you're prompted to supply the server name, a [!INCLUDE [ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] login, and a password, if necessary. If you sign in to [!INCLUDE [ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] using Windows Authentication, you don't have to provide a SQL Server login each time you access an instance of [!INCLUDE [ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)]. Instead, [!INCLUDE [ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] uses your Windows account to log you in automatically.

If [!INCLUDE [ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] is running in mixed mode authentication ([!INCLUDE [ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] and Windows Authentication Mode), and you choose to sign in using [!INCLUDE [ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Authentication, you must provide a [!INCLUDE [ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] login and password. When possible, use Windows Authentication.

If you installed [!INCLUDE [ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] with a case-sensitive collation, your [!INCLUDE [ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] login is also case sensitive.

## Format for specifying the instance name

When connecting to an instance of the [!INCLUDE [ssDE](../../includes/ssde-md.md)], you must specify the name of the instance of [!INCLUDE [ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)]. If the instance of [!INCLUDE [ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] is the default instance (an unnamed instance), then specify the name of the computer where [!INCLUDE [ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] is installed, or the IP address of the computer. If the instance of [!INCLUDE [ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] is a named instance (such as `SQLEXPRESS`), then specify the name of the computer where [!INCLUDE [ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] is installed, or the IP address of the computer, and add a slash and the instance name.

The following examples connect to an instance of [!INCLUDE [ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] running on a computer named `APPHOST`. When you specify a named instance, the examples use an instance name `SQLEXPRESS`.

## Examples

| Type of instance | Entry for the server name |
| --- | --- |
| Connection to a default instance using the default protocol. | `APPHOST` |
| Connection to a named instance using the default protocol. | `APPHOST\SQLEXPRESS` |
| Connection to a default instance on the same computer using a period to indicate that the instance is running on the local computer. | `.` |
| Connection to a named instance on the same computer using a period to indicate that the instance is running on the local computer. | `.\SQLEXPRESS` |
| Connection to a default instance on the same computer using localhost to indicate that the instance is running on the local computer. | `localhost` |
| Connection to a named instance on the same computer using localhost to indicate that the instance is running on the local computer. | `localhost\SQLEXPRESS` |
| Connection to a default instance on the same computer using (local) to indicate that the instance is running on the local computer. | `(local)` |
| Connection to a named instance on the same computer using (local) to indicate that the instance is running on the local computer. | `(local)\SQLEXPRESS` |
| Connection to a default instance on the same computer forcing a shared memory connection. | `lpc:APPHOST` |
| Connection to a named instance on the same computer forcing a shared memory connection. | `lpc:APPHOST\SQLEXPRESS` |
| Connection to a default instance listening on TCP address 192.168.17.28 using an IP address. | `192.168.17.28` |
| Connection to a named instance listening on TCP address 192.168.17.28 using an IP address. | `192.168.17.28\SQLEXPRESS` |
| Connection to a default instance that isn't listening on the default TCP port, by specifying the port that is being used, in this case 2828. (Specifying a port number isn't necessary if the [!INCLUDE [ssDE](../../includes/ssde-md.md)] is listening on the default port (1433).) | `APPHOST,2828` |
| Connection to a named instance on a designated TCP port, in this case 2828. (Specifying a port number is often necessary if the [!INCLUDE [ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Browser service isn't running on the host computer.) | `APPHOST,2828` |
| Connection to a default instance that isn't listening on the default TCP port, by specifying both the IP address and the TCP port that is being used, in this case 2828. | `192.168.17.28,2828` |
| Connection to a named instance by specifying both the IP address and the TCP port that is being used, in this case 2828. | `192.168.17.28\SQLEXPRESS,2828` |
| Connecting to default instance by name, forcing a TCP connection. | `tcp:APPHOST` |
| Connecting to named instance by name, forcing a TCP connection. | `tcp:APPHOST\SQLEXPRESS` |
| Connecting to a default instance by specifying a named pipe name. | `\\APPHOST\pipe\SQL\query` |
| Connecting to a named instance by specifying a named pipe name. | `\\APPHOST\pipe\MSSQL$SQLEXPRESS\SQL\query` |
| Connecting to default instance by name, forcing a named pipes connection. | `np:APPHOST` |
| Connecting to named instance by name, forcing a named pipes connection. | `np:APPHOST\SQLEXPRESS` |

## Verify your connection protocol

When connected to the [!INCLUDE [ssDE](../../includes/ssde-md.md)], the following query returns the protocol used for the current connection, along with the authentication method (NTLM or Kerberos), and indicates if the connection is encrypted.

```sql
SELECT net_transport,
       auth_scheme,
       encrypt_option
FROM sys.dm_exec_connections
WHERE session_id = @@SPID;
```
