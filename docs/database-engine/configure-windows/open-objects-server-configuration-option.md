# Server configuration: open objects

[!INCLUDE [SQL Server](../../includes/applies-to-version/sqlserver.md)]

This option is still present in `sp_configure`, although its functionality has been disabled in [!INCLUDE [ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)]. (The setting has no effect.) In [!INCLUDE [ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)], the number of open database objects is managed dynamically and is limited only by the available memory. The `open objects` option available in `sp_configure` for backward compatibility with existing scripts.
