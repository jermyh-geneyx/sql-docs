# Server configuration: SMO and DMO XPs

[!INCLUDE [SQL Server](../../includes/applies-to-version/sqlserver.md)]

Use the SMO and DMO XPs option to enable [!INCLUDE [ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Management Object (SMO) extended stored procedures on this server.

Note than beginning in [!INCLUDE [ssSQL11](../../includes/sssql11-md.md)], DMO has been removed from [!INCLUDE [ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)].

The possible values are described in the following table:

| Value | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `0` | SMO XPs aren't available. |
| `1` | SMO XPs are available. This is the default. |

The setting takes effect immediately.

## Examples

The following example enables SMO extended stored procedures.

```sql
EXECUTE sp_configure 'show advanced options', 1;
GO

RECONFIGURE;
GO

EXECUTE sp_configure 'SMO and DMO XPs', 1;
GO

RECONFIGURE;
GO
```
