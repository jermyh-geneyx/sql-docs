# Server Properties (Processors page)

[!INCLUDE [SQL Server](../../includes/applies-to-version/sqlserver.md)]

Use this page to view or modify your processor options. Processor affinity settings are only enabled when more than one processor is installed.

## Options

### Processor Affinity

Assigns processors to specific threads to eliminating processor reloads and reduce thread migration across processors. For more information, see [affinity mask Server Configuration Option](affinity-mask-server-configuration-option.md).

### I/O Affinity

Binds [!INCLUDE [msCoName](../../includes/msconame-md.md)] SQL Server disk I/Os to a specified subset of CPUs. For more information, see [affinity Input-Output mask Server Configuration Option](affinity-input-output-mask-server-configuration-option.md).

### Automatically set processor affinity mask for all processors

Allows SQL Server to set the processor affinity.

### Automatically set I/O affinity mask for all processors

Allows SQL Server to set the I/O affinity.

### Maximum worker threads

0 allows SQL Server to dynamically set the number of worker threads. This setting is best for most systems. However, depending on your system configuration, setting this option to a specific value sometimes improves performance. For more information, see [Server configuration: max worker threads](configure-the-max-worker-threads-server-configuration-option.md).

### Boost SQL Server priority

Specifies whether SQL Server should run at a higher Microsoft Windows scheduling priority rather than other processes on the same computer. For more information, see [Server configuration: priority boost](configure-the-priority-boost-server-configuration-option.md).

> [!NOTE]  
> This option isn't available with SSMS 18.x and later versions.

### Use Windows fibers (lightweight pooling)

Use Windows fibers instead of threads for the SQL Server service. This is only available in Windows 2003 Server Edition. For more information, see [lightweight pooling Server Configuration Option](lightweight-pooling-server-configuration-option.md).

> [!NOTE]  
> This option isn't available with SSMS 18.x and later versions.

### Configured Values

Displays the configured values for the options on this pane. If you change these values, select **Running Values** to see whether the changes have taken effect. If they haven't, the instance of SQL Server must be restarted first.

### Running Values

View the currently running values for the options on this pane. These values are read-only.
