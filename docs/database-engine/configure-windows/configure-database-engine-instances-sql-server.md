# Configure Database Engine instances (SQL Server)

[!INCLUDE [SQL Server](../../includes/applies-to-version/sqlserver.md)]

Each instance of the [!INCLUDE [ssDE](../../includes/ssde-md.md)] must be configured to meet the performance and availability requirements defined for the databases hosted by the instance. The [!INCLUDE [ssDE](../../includes/ssde-md.md)] includes configuration options that control behaviors such as resource usage and the availability of features such as auditing or trigger recursion.

## Instance configuration

When a database is deployed into production, there's often a service level agreement (SLA) defining areas such as the levels of performance required from the database and the required availability level of the database. The terms of the SLA typically drive configuration requirements for the instance.

An instance is usually configured immediately after it has been installed. The initial configuration is usually determined by the SLA requirements of the types of databases planned to be deployed to the instance. After the databases have been deployed, the database administrators monitor the performance of the instance and adjust the configuration settings as needed if the performance metrics show the instance isn't meeting the SLA requirements.
