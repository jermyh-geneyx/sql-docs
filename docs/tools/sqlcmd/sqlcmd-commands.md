# Commands in the sqlcmd utility

[!INCLUDE [SQL Server Azure SQL Database Azure SQL Managed Instance Azure Synapse Analytics PDW FabricSQLDB](../../includes/applies-to-version/sql-asdb-asdbmi-asa-pdw-fabricsqldb.md)]

The [sqlcmd utility](sqlcmd-utility.md) lets you enter Transact-SQL statements, system procedures, and script files.

> [!NOTE]  
> To find out which variant and version of **sqlcmd** is installed on your system, see [Check installed version of sqlcmd utility](sqlcmd-installed-version.md). For information on how to get **sqlcmd**, see [Download and install the sqlcmd utility](sqlcmd-download-install.md).

In addition to Transact-SQL statements within **sqlcmd**, the following commands are also available:

- `GO [ <count> ]`
- `:List`
- `[:]RESET`
- `:Error`
- `[:]ED` <sup>1</sup>
- `:Out`
- `[:]!!`
- `:Perftrace`
- `[:]QUIT`
- `:Connect`
- `[:]EXIT`
- `:On Error`
- `:r`
- `:Help`
- `:ServerList` <sup>1</sup>
- `:XML [ ON | OFF ]` <sup>1</sup>
- `:Setvar`
- `:Listvar`

<sup>1</sup> Not supported on Linux or macOS.

Be aware of the following when you use **sqlcmd** commands:

- All **sqlcmd** commands, except `GO`, must be prefixed by a colon (`:`).

  > [!IMPORTANT]  
  > To maintain backward compatibility with existing **osql** scripts, some of the commands are recognized without the colon, indicated by the `:`.

- **sqlcmd** commands are recognized only if they appear at the start of a line.

- All **sqlcmd** commands are case insensitive.

- Each command must be on a separate line. A command can't be followed by a Transact-SQL statement or another command.

- Commands are executed immediately. They aren't put in the execution buffer as Transact-SQL statements are.

## Editing commands

#### [:]ED

Starts the text editor. This editor can be used to edit the current Transact-SQL batch, or the last executed batch. To edit the last executed batch, the `ED` command must be typed immediately after the last batch has completed execution.

The text editor is defined by the `SQLCMDEDITOR` environment variable. The default editor is `Edit`. To change the editor, set the `SQLCMDEDITOR` environment variable. For example, to set the editor to Microsoft Notepad, at the command prompt, type:

`SET SQLCMDEDITOR=notepad`

#### [:]RESET

Clears the statement cache.

#### :List

Prints the content of the statement cache.

## Variables

#### :Setvar \<var> [ "*value*" ]

Defines **sqlcmd** scripting variables. Scripting variables have the following format: `$(VARNAME)`.

Variable names are case insensitive.

Scripting variables can be set in the following ways:

- Implicitly using a command-line option. For example, the `-l` option sets the `SQLCMDLOGINTIMEOUT` **sqlcmd** variable.
- Explicitly by using the `:Setvar` command.
- Defining an environment variable before you run **sqlcmd**.

> [!NOTE]  
> The `-X` option prevents environment variables from being passed on to **sqlcmd**.

If a variable defined by using `:Setvar` and an environment variable have the same name, the variable defined by using `:Setvar` takes precedence.

Variable names must not contain blank space characters.

Variable names can't have the same form as a variable expression, such as `$(var)`.

If the string value of the scripting variable contains blank spaces, enclose the value in quotation marks. If a value for a scripting variable isn't specified, the scripting variable is dropped.

#### :Listvar

Displays a list of the scripting variables that are currently set.

> [!NOTE]  
> Only scripting variables that are set by **sqlcmd**, and variables that are set using the `:Setvar` command, are displayed.

## Output commands

#### :Error \<*filename*> | STDERR | STDOUT

Redirect all error output to the file specified by *filename*, to `stderr` or to `stdout`. The `:Error` command can appear multiple times in a script. By default, error output is sent to `stderr`.

- *filename*

  Creates and opens a file that receives the output. If the file already exists, it's truncated to zero bytes. If the file isn't available because of permissions or other reasons, the output isn't switched, and is sent to the last specified or default destination.

- STDERR

  Switches error output to the `stderr` stream. If output has been redirected, the target to which the stream is redirected receives the error output.

- STDOUT

  Switches error output to the `stdout` stream. If output has been redirected, the target to which the stream is redirected receives the error output.

#### :Out \<*filename*> | STDERR | STDOUT

Creates and redirects all query results to the file specified by *file name*, to `stderr` or to `stdout`. By default, output is sent to `stdout`. If the file already exists, it's truncated to zero bytes. The `:Out` command can appear multiple times in a script.

#### :Perftrace \<*filename*> | STDERR | STDOUT

Creates and redirects all performance trace information to the file specified by *file name*, to `stderr` or to `stdout`. By default performance trace output is sent to `stdout`. If the file already exists, it's truncated to zero bytes. The `:Perftrace` command can appear multiple times in a script.

## Execution control commands

#### :On Error [ exit | ignore ]

Sets the action to be performed when an error occurs during script or batch execution.

When the `exit` option is used, **sqlcmd** exits with the appropriate error value.

When the `ignore` option is used, **sqlcmd** ignores the error and continues executing the batch or script. By default, an error message is printed.

#### [:]QUIT

Causes **sqlcmd** to exit.

#### [:]EXIT [ ( *statement* ) ]

Lets you use the result of a `SELECT` statement as the return value from **sqlcmd**. If numeric, the first column of the last result row is converted to a 4-byte integer (long). MS-DOS, Linux, and macOS pass the low byte to the parent process or operating system error level. Windows 2000 and later versions passes the whole 4-byte integer. The syntax is `:EXIT(query)`.

For example:

```text
:EXIT(SELECT @@ROWCOUNT)
```

You can also include the `:EXIT` parameter as part of a batch file. For example, at the command prompt, type:

`sqlcmd -Q ":EXIT(SELECT COUNT(*) FROM '%1')"`

The **sqlcmd** utility sends everything between the parentheses (`()`) to the server. If a system stored procedure selects a set and returns a value, only the selection is returned. The `:EXIT()` statement with nothing between the parentheses executes everything before it in the batch, and then exits without a return value.

When an incorrect query is specified, **sqlcmd** exits without a return value.

Here's a list of `EXIT` formats:

- `:EXIT`

  Doesn't execute the batch, and then quits immediately and returns no value.

- `:EXIT( )`

  Executes the batch, and then quits and returns no value.

- `:EXIT(query)`

  Executes the batch that includes the query, and then quits after it returns the results of the query.

If `RAISERROR` is used within a **sqlcmd** script, and a state of 127 is raised, **sqlcmd** quits, and returns the message ID back to the client. For example:

```text
RAISERROR(50001, 10, 127)
```

This error causes the **sqlcmd** script to end and return the message ID 50001 to the client.

The return values `-1` to `-99` are reserved by [!INCLUDE [ssnoversion-md](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)], and **sqlcmd** defines the following additional return values:

| Return value | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `-100` | Error encountered before selecting return value. |
| `-101` | No rows found when selecting return value. |
| `-102` | Conversion error occurred when selecting return value. |

#### GO [*count*]

`GO` signals both the end of a batch and the execution of any cached Transact-SQL statements. The batch is executed multiple times as separate batches. You can't declare a variable more than once in a single batch.

## Miscellaneous commands

#### :r \<*filename*>

Parses additional Transact-SQL statements and **sqlcmd** commands from the file specified by *filename* into the statement cache. *filename* is read relative to the startup directory in which **sqlcmd** was run.

If the file contains Transact-SQL statements that aren't followed by `GO`, you must enter `GO` on the line that follows `:r`.

The file will be read and executed after a batch terminator is encountered. You can issue multiple `:r` commands. The file can include any **sqlcmd** command, including the batch terminator `GO`.

> [!NOTE]  
> The line count that is displayed in interactive mode is increased by one for every `:r` command encountered. The `:r` command appears in the output of the list command.

#### :ServerList

Lists the locally configured servers and the names of the servers broadcasting on the network.

#### :Connect *server_name*[\\*instance_name*] [-l *timeout*] [-U *user_name* [-P *password*]]

Connects to an instance of [!INCLUDE [ssnoversion-md](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)]. Also closes the current connection.

Timeout options:

| Value | Behavior |
| --- | --- |
| `0` | Wait forever |
| `n>0` | Wait for *n* seconds |

The `SQLCMDSERVER` scripting variable reflects the current active connection.

If *timeout* isn't specified, the value of the `SQLCMDLOGINTIMEOUT` variable is the default.

If only *user_name* is specified (either as an option, or as an environment variable), the user is prompted to enter a password. Users aren't prompted if the `SQLCMDUSER` or `SQLCMDPASSWORD` environment variables are set. If you don't provide options or environment variables, Windows Authentication mode is used to sign in. For example, to connect to an instance, `instance1`, of [!INCLUDE [ssnoversion-md](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)], `myserver`, by using integrated security you would use the following command:

```text
:connect myserver\instance1
```

To connect to the default instance of `myserver` using scripting variables, you would use the following settings:

```text
:setvar myusername test
:setvar myservername myserver
:connect $(myservername) $(myusername)
```

#### [:]!! *command*

Executes operating system commands. To execute an operating system command, start a line with two exclamation marks (`!!`) followed by the operating system command. For example:

```text
:!! dir
```

> [!NOTE]  
> The command is executed on the computer on which **sqlcmd** is running.

#### :XML [ ON | OFF ]

For more information, see [XML Output Format](#OutputXML) and [JSON Output Format](#OutputJSON) in this article.

#### :Help

Lists **sqlcmd** commands, together with a short description of each command.

## sqlcmd file names

**sqlcmd** input files can be specified with the `-i` option or the `:r` command. Output files can be specified with the `-o` option or the `:Error`, `:Out`, and `:Perftrace` commands. The following are some guidelines for working with these files:

- `:Error`, `:Out`, and `:Perftrace` should use separate *filename* values. If the same *filename* is used, inputs from the commands might be intermixed.

- If an input file that is located on a remote server is called from **sqlcmd** on a local computer, and the file contains a drive file path such as `:Out c:\OutputFile.txt`, the output file is created on the local computer and not on the remote server.

- Valid file paths include: `C:\<filename>`, `\\<Server>\<Share$>\<filename>`, and `"C:\Some Folder\<file name>"`. If there's a space in the path, use quotation marks.

- Each new **sqlcmd** session overwrites existing files that have the same names.

## Informational messages

**sqlcmd** prints any informational message that is sent by the server. In the following example, after the Transact-SQL statements are executed, an informational message is printed.

Start **sqlcmd**. At the **sqlcmd** command prompt, type the query:

```sql
USE AdventureWorks2022;
GO
```

When you press <kbd>ENTER</kbd>, the following informational message is printed:

```output
Changed database context to 'AdventureWorks2022'.
```

## Output format from Transact-SQL queries

**sqlcmd** first prints a column header that contains the column names specified in the select list. The column names are separated by using the `SQLCMDCOLSEP` character. By default, this column separator is a space. If the column name is shorter than the column width, the output is padded with spaces up to the next column.

This line is followed by a separator line that is a series of dash characters. The following output shows an example.

Start **sqlcmd**. At the **sqlcmd** command prompt, type the query:

```sql
USE AdventureWorks2022;

SELECT TOP (2) BusinessEntityID,
               FirstName,
               LastName
FROM Person.Person;
GO
```

When you press <kbd>ENTER</kbd>, the following result set is returned.

```output
BusinessEntityID FirstName    LastName
---------------- ------------ ----------
285              Syed         Abbas
293              Catherine    Abel
(2 row(s) affected)
```

Although the `BusinessEntityID` column is only four characters wide, it expands to accommodate the longer column name. By default, output is terminated at 80 characters. This width can be changed by using the `-w` option, or by setting the `SQLCMDCOLWIDTH` scripting variable.

## XML output format

XML output that is the result of a `FOR XML` clause is output, unformatted, in a continuous stream.

When you expect XML output, use the following command: `:XML ON`.

> [!NOTE]  
> **sqlcmd** returns error messages in the usual format. The error messages are also output in the XML text stream in XML format. By using `:XML ON`, **sqlcmd** doesn't display informational messages.

To set the XML mode to off, use the following command: `:XML OFF`.

The `GO` command shouldn't appear before the `:XML OFF` command is issued, because the `:XML OFF` command switches **sqlcmd** back to row-oriented output.

XML (streamed) data and rowset data can't be mixed. If the `:XML ON` command wasn't issued before a Transact-SQL statement that outputs XML streams is executed, the output is garbled. Once the `:XML ON` command is issued, you can't execute Transact-SQL statements that output regular row sets.

> [!NOTE]  
> The `:XML` command doesn't support the `SET STATISTICS XML` statement.

<a id="OutputJSON"></a>

## JSON output format

When you expect JSON output, use the following command: `:XML ON`. Otherwise, the output includes both the column name and the JSON text. This output isn't valid JSON.

To set the XML mode to off, use the following command: `:XML OFF`.

For more info, see [XML Output Format](#OutputXML) in this article.
