# sqlagent application

[!INCLUDE [sqlserver](../includes/applies-to-version/sqlserver.md)]

The **sqlagent** application starts [!INCLUDE [ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Agent from the command prompt. Usually, [!INCLUDE [ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Agent should be run from [!INCLUDE [ssManStudioFull](../includes/ssmanstudiofull-md.md)] or by using SQL-SMO methods in an application. Only run **sqlagent** from the command prompt when you're diagnosing [!INCLUDE [ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Agent, or when you're directed to it by your primary support provider.

## Syntax

```console
sqlagent
-c [ -v ] [ -i instance_name ]
```

## Arguments

#### -c

Indicates that [!INCLUDE [ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Agent is running from the command prompt and is independent of the Microsoft Windows Services Control Manager. When `-c` is used, [!INCLUDE [ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Agent can't be controlled from either the Services application in Administrative Tools or [!INCLUDE [ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Configuration Manager. This argument is mandatory.

#### -v

Indicates that [!INCLUDE [ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Agent runs in verbose mode and writes diagnostic information to the command-prompt window. The diagnostic information is the same as the information written to the [!INCLUDE [ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Agent error log.

#### -i *instance_name*

Indicates that [!INCLUDE [ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Agent connects to the named [!INCLUDE [ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] instance specified by *instance_name*.

## Remarks

After it displays a copyright message, **sqlagent** displays output in the command prompt window only when the `-v` switch is specified. To stop **sqlagent**, press **Ctrl**+**C** at the command prompt. Don't close the command-prompt window before stopping **sqlagent**.
