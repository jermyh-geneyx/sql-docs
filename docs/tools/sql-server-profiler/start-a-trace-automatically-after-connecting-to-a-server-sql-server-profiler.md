# Start a trace automatically after connecting to a server (SQL Server Profiler)

[!INCLUDE [SQL Server Azure SQL Managed Instance](../../includes/applies-to-version/sql-asdbmi.md)]

This article describes how to start traces automatically after connecting to an instance of [!INCLUDE [ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] by using [!INCLUDE [ssSqlProfiler](../../includes/sssqlprofiler-md.md)].

## Start a trace automatically after connecting to a server with SQL Server Profiler

1. On the **Tools** menu, select **Options**.

1. Select the **Start tracing immediately after making a connection** check box.

If **Start tracing immediately after making connection** is selected, the **Trace Properties** dialog box fails to appear and the trace begins instead. To edit trace properties, you must first turn this setting off.
