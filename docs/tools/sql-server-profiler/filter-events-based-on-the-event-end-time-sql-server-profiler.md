# Filter events based on the event end Time (SQL Server Profiler)

[!INCLUDE [SQL Server Azure SQL Managed Instance](../../includes/applies-to-version/sql-asdbmi.md)]

This article describes how to filter trace events based on the event ending time by using [!INCLUDE [ssSqlProfiler](../../includes/sssqlprofiler-md.md)].

## Filter events based on the event end time

1. On the **File** menu, select **New Trace**, and then connect to an instance of [!INCLUDE [ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)].

   The **Trace Properties** dialog box appears.

   If **Start tracing immediately after making connection** is selected, the **Trace Properties** dialog box fails to appear and the trace begins instead. To turn off this setting, on the **Tools** menu, select **Options**, and clear the **Start tracing immediately after making connection** check box.

1. In the **Trace Properties** dialog box, make sure the **General** tab is selected, and enter a name in the **TraceName** text box.

1. From the **Use the template** list, select a trace template.

1. Optionally, specify a destination file or table in which to save the trace results.

1. On the **Events Selection** tab, select the **EndTime** data column to launch the **Edit Filter** dialog box. You can also right-click the column heading, and select **Edit Column Filter**.

1. Expand **Greater than** or **Less than**, and enter a **datetime** value in the field that appears beneath the comparison operator.
