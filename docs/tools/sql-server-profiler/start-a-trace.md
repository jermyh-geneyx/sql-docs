# Start a trace (SQL Server Profiler)

[!INCLUDE [SQL Server Azure SQL Managed Instance](../../includes/applies-to-version/sql-asdbmi.md)]

After you have defined a new trace or created a template by using [!INCLUDE [ssSqlProfiler](../../includes/sssqlprofiler-md.md)], you can start, pause, or stop capturing data by using the new trace definition or template.

## Start a Profiler trace

When you start a trace and the defined source is an instance of the [!INCLUDE [ssDEnoversion](../../includes/ssdenoversion-md.md)] or [!INCLUDE [ssASnoversion](../../includes/ssasnoversion-md.md)], [!INCLUDE [ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] creates a queue that provides a temporary holding place for captured server events.

When you use [!INCLUDE [ssSqlProfiler](../../includes/sssqlprofiler-md.md)] to access SQL Trace, a new trace window opens (if one isn't already open) when a trace is started, and data is immediately captured.

When you use [!INCLUDE [tsql](../../includes/tsql-md.md)] system stored procedures to access SQL Trace, you must start a trace every time an instance of [!INCLUDE [ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] starts for data to be captured. When a trace has been started, you can modify only the name of the trace.

When working with existing traces, you can view the properties, but you can't modify the properties. To modify the properties, stop or pause the trace.
