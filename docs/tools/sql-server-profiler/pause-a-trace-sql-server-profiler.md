# Pause a trace (SQL Server Profiler)

[!INCLUDE [SQL Server Azure SQL Managed Instance](../../includes/applies-to-version/sql-asdbmi.md)]

Pausing a trace prevents further event data from being captured until the trace is restarted.

When you pause a trace, you prevent event data from being captured until the trace is restarted. Restarting a trace lets trace operations resume. No previously captured data is lost after a restart. When the trace is restarted, data capturing resumes from that point onward. While a trace is paused, you can change the name, events, columns, and filters. However, you can't change the destinations to which you're sending the trace data, nor change the server connection.

## Pause a trace

1. Select a window that contains a running trace.

1. On the **File** menu, select **Pause Trace**.
