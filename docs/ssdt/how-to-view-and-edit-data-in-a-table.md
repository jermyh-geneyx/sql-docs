# How to: View and edit data in a table

You can view, edit, and delete data in an existing table by using a visual Data Editor.

> [!WARNING]  
> The following procedure uses entities created in previous procedures in the [SQL database projects](../tools/sql-database-projects/sql-database-projects.md) sections.

## Edit data in a table visually using the Data Editor

1. Right-click the `Products` table in **SQL Server Object Explorer**, and select **View Data**.

1. The Data Editor launches. Notice the rows we added to the table in previous procedures.

1. Right-click the `Fruits` table in SQL Server Object Explorer, and select **View Data**.

1. In the Data Editor, type `1` for **Id** and **True** for **Perishable**, then either press ENTER or TAB to shift focus away from the new row to commit it to the database.

1. Repeat the previous step to enter `2`, **False**, and `3`, **False** to the table.

   As you're editing a row, you can always revert the changes to a cell by pressing ESC.

1. You can view your edits as a script by selecting the **Script** button on the toolbar. Alternatively, you can use the **Script to File** button to save them in a `.sql` script file to be executed later.

1. Right-click the `Trade` database in **SQL Server Object Explorer**, and select **New Query**. In the editor, type `SELECT * from dbo.PerishableFruits` and press the **Execute Query** button to return the data represented by the `PerishableFruits` view.
