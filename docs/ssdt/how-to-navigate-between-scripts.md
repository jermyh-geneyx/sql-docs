# How to: Navigate between scripts

The Transact-SQL Editor for offline development provides two useful navigation tools that are familiar to Visual Studio users: Go To Definition and Find All References. For example, you can right-click a table name and use "Find All References" to list all references to the table in the project. You can double-click a search result to go to the specific code file. In this file, you can right-click the table name again, and choose "Go to Definition" to go back to the table definition.

> [!WARNING]  
> The following procedure uses entities created in previous procedures in the [SQL database projects](../tools/sql-database-projects/sql-database-projects.md) sections.

## Navigate between scripts

1. Expand the **Functions** folder in **Solution Explorer** and double-click `GetProductsBySupplier.sql`.

1. Right-click `Products` in this line of code and select **Go To Definition**

   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM Products AS p;
   ```

1. `Products.sql` is automatically opened, showing the location where the `Products` type is defined.

1. Go back to `GetProductsBySupplier.sql`. This time selects **Find All References** in the contextual menu for `Products`. In the **Find Symbol Results** pane, you see a list of locations where the `Products` table is referenced. Double-clicking any of the search results bring you to the location of the reference.
